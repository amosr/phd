Distribute N-body problem into a heirarchical octree, allowing $n \log n$ instead of $n^2$ interactions.
Existing hierarchical N-body simulations exist (Appel, Jernigan, Porter) but the loss in accuracy is hard to analyse. Is this because the tree structure is not necessarily a space partitioning?
A better idea of where the accuracy errors are is possible because the octree is an up-to-date space partitioning.

\rev{A modified tree code: don't laugh; it runs}{barnes1990modified}
A modification of Barnes-Hut that is better for vector machines. By sharing some of the 'interaction list' between nearby particles.
Meh.
