\section{Streams and dataflow}

\rev{Advances in Dataflow Programming Languages}{johnston2004advances}
Broad overview of different dataflow based languages.
Originally targetting dataflow computers but also von Neumann. Eh.


\rev{A survey of stream processing}{stephens1997survey}
Stream processing systems can be thought of as a directed graph,
but provides a more rigorous formal definition.
Goes through many languages showing their primitive operations and
implementing a flip-flop in each. 
Many variations. Many references to other papers.
